# qewd-svelte
This repo provides a set of svelte stores as wrappers for the  [qewd-client](https://github.com/robtweed/qewd-client/) for use in a svelte app.


A sample implementation is shown in the `./examples` folder. Currently I've only included a svelte v3 example, but the same principals apply for v4/v5 â€“ i.e. simply include and use the provided svelte store.
